The part of the game i am most proud of is creating and balancing enemies as well as creating the wave manager sure i had some problems and looked for the internet for answers but it is the one i am proud of along with creating the basic look of the game. Due to my sickness and weakness I had to rely to the internet for help when things got hard and takes to much time in solving. I know I could have done better and would do if I have given another chance but its not worth regretting. This test taught me alot about how others code and things about myse=ld. I do hope I pass. As for the feauture i want to show the most it would be the enemy spawning with different traits and characteristic 2 enemies there disappear and reappear as well as the pause button which changes when winning or losing.
