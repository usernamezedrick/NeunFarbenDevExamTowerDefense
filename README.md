The part of the game i am most proud of is creating and balancing enemis as well as creating the wave manager sure i had some problems and looked for the internet for answers but it is the one i am proud of along with creating the absic look of the gam. Due to my sickness and weakness I had to rely to the internet for help when things got hard and takes to much time in soling. I know I could have done better and would do if I have given another chance but its not worth regretting. This test taught me alot about how others code and things about myse=ld. I do hope I pass.
